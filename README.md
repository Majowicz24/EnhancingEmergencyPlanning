# ENHANCING EMERGENCY PLANNING DURING POWER OUTAGES USING MACHINE LEARNING
This thesis explores advanced strategies for optimizing rescue operations by emergency responders, focusing on improving efficiency beyond traditional door-to-door methods. Centered around the Buffalo Blizzard of 2022 as a case study, the research aims to reduce travel time and distance for emergency responders while ensuring priority aid to homes most at risk. The study analyzes annual building load profiles from the ResStock database to classify home appliance fuel types using machine learning models. These classifications are then integrated into a genetic evolutionary algorithm, enabling responders to distinguish between priority and secondary homes in simulated scenarios. Machine learning models evaluate power consumption data on a monthly basis, and road network data from Buffalo, NY, combined with classifications from an SVC model, further refine the algorithm. Findings reveal that this approach can decrease the time and distance emergency responders need to reach priority homes by over 50 percent, offering a more effective solution for community assistance and reducing reliance on door-to-door methods. The genetic algorithm demonstrates potential for expansion, incorporating multiple home attributes and broader road network analysis. This integration of evolutionary algorithms and machine learning predictions offers a promising avenue for enhancing the decision-making process in emergency response, with the potential to save more lives.
